Due to GitHub's file size limit, Iâ€™ve decided to create a standalone website. The link is below. It is browser-based, which should make things a bit easier.

**************
These are supplementary files for the text: Introduction to Differential Equations (3d Edition) by Mark H. Holmes

If you want the entire web-site: you should download the folder WebPages.  To do this, click on the green Code button above and select "Download ZIP."  You can then uncompress the various zip files by simplying clicking on them.  The web-site is then available by clicking on the file index.2400.html.

If you just want the movies: download the zip files in the folder WebPages, and then uncompress them (which you can do by simplying clicking on them)
